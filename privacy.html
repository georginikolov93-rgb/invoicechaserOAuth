  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> [e.g., 9 November 2025]</p>

  <p><strong>Invoice Chaser</strong> (“we”, “us”, “our”) is a tool that helps users automate invoice follow-ups and collections. This policy describes how we handle your information.</p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Account info:</strong> name, email, and workspace details you provide.</li>
    <li><strong>Billing info:</strong> handled by our payment processor (e.g., Stripe). We do not store full card numbers.</li>
    <li><strong>Integrations:</strong> If you connect Gmail, we may access the specific Gmail scopes you authorize (typically <code>gmail.send</code> and, if configured, <code>gmail.readonly</code>/<code>gmail.modify</code> for threading and status). If you connect Xero, we access invoices, contacts, and payments as permitted by your Xero consent.</li>
    <li><strong>Usage data:</strong> app events, logs, and device information to maintain and improve the service.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide and operate the app (drafting/sending follow-up emails, tracking statuses, syncing with Xero).</li>
    <li>Maintain security, debug issues, and improve features.</li>
    <li>Send important service notices and respond to support requests.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Gmail Limited Use Compliance</h2>
  <p>If you authorize Gmail access, we adhere to Google’s <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">API Services User Data Policy</a>, including the Limited Use requirements. We only use the granted Gmail data to provide user-visible features (e.g., sending follow-up emails on your behalf), do not transfer Gmail data except to provide or improve these features, do not use Gmail data for advertising, and only store what is necessary for the feature to function. You can revoke access anytime in your Google Account’s Security settings.</p>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not sell personal information. We share data with service providers that help us run the app (e.g., hosting, error monitoring, analytics, email delivery, and payments) under appropriate confidentiality and security commitments.</p>

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
  <p>We retain information only as long as needed to provide the service and meet legal obligations. You may request deletion of your account data at any time (see “Your Rights”).</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>We apply reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your data. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

  <h2>Your Rights</h2>
  <p>You may request access, correction, export, or deletion of your data by contacting us at <a href="mailto:[your-support-email]">[your-support-email]</a>. If you revoke OAuth permissions with Google or Xero, certain features will stop working.</p>

  <h2>International Transfers</h2>
  <p>We may process data in countries other than where you live. Where required, we use appropriate safeguards for cross-border transfers.</p>

  <h2>Children</h2>
  <p>The service is not intended for children under 13.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>[Your legal name or company], [your business address or city/country]<br>
     Email: <a href="mailto:[your-support-email]">[your-support-email]</a></p>

  <h2>Changes</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy. If changes are material, we will provide notice in the app or by email.</p>
