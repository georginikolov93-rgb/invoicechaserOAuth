  <h2>3. Integrations</h2>
  <p>When you connect third-party services (e.g., Google/Gmail, Xero, Stripe), you authorize us to access and process data as permitted by those providers and your consents. Your use of third-party services is subject to their terms and policies.</p>

  <h2>4. Fees & Payments</h2>
  <p>Paid plans, transaction fees, and billing terms are described in the app or ordering flow. Unless stated otherwise, fees are non-refundable. We may change pricing on notice for future billing cycles.</p>

  <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, our aggregate liability arising out of or relating to the Service is limited to the amounts you paid us in the 12 months before the event giving rise to the claim. We are not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages.</p>
